Explanation on why the log a little different from expected log:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

In our application, T3 run for about 2756 ticks instead of 3000 ticks.

Hence, it will be completed at ticks of 7836 instead of 8xxx, 
and the log will show "7" instead of "8" for second deletion of T2.
